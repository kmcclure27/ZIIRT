\title{Find b1 for MZI given a target Zero-Inflation Level}
\usage{
MZI_find_b1(propZI0, b0, n = 1, tol = 0.1, thr = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{propZI0}{The target proportion of zeros due to (lack of) presence. Must be a decimal between 0 and 1.}

\item{b0}{Item Intercept controlling potential zeros from the presence component of the MZIGRM}

\item{n}{The number of candidate b0 to output. The n that provide the closest propZI0 are returned}

\item{tol}{A tolerance threshold that issues a warning if the resulting proportion of zero inflation is more than tol from the target}

\item{thr}{An alternative to n that outputs all b1 parameters with thr of the target; defaults to NULL}
}
\value{
A n-row dataframe with columns for 1) expected proportion of zero inflated due to low presence, 2) b0, and 3) b1
}
\description{
Finds item intercept(s) for the severity latent variable in the MZI given target level of zero-inflation due to (lack of) presence and the item intercept controlling zeros from low presence
Assumes that the presence/severity latent variables are standard bivariate normal.
